# Bash - "Bourne Again Shell"

- Developed for GNU project.
- Bash is compatible with **Bourne Shell** - is the original standard for UNIX shell.
- Shell scripts are interpeted - line by line.
- Security: in linux, bash / shell files don't have execution permissions by default.

* If we want to execute file directly - use `chmod` command:

```bash
chmod +x file_name.sh
# or
chmod 777 file_name.sh
```

- run the executable file:

```bash
./file_name.sh
```
